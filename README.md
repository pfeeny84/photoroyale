# PhotoRoyale

Photoshop Battles are usually in social media threads that require users to link their edited photos in the comments.

These links do not provide a visually pleasing or simple to navigate experience.
They are often not even links to the photos!

Photo Royale will provide a simple and easy to navigate UI that will let users upload and edit photos, then post their edited images in a clean and legible thread.
No more links!!!!
